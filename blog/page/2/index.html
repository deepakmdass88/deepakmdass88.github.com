  <div class="entry-content"><p>Being a <code>DevOps</code> guy, i always love metrics. Visualized metrics gives a good picture of what&#8217;s happening in our live battle stations. There are now a quite lot of Open Source tools for monitoring and visualizing. It&#8217;s more than a year since i&#8217;ve started using <em>Logstash</em>. It never turned me down. <code>ElasticSearch-Logstash-Kibana</code> (ELK) is a killer combination. Though i started Elasticsearch + Logstash as a log analyzer, later <a href="https://github.com/etsy/statsd/">StatsD</a> and <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a> took it to the next level. When we have a simple infrastructure it&#8217;s easy to monitor. But when the infra starts scaling, it becomes quite difficult to keep track of all the events happening inside each nodes. Though service checks can help, but there is still limitation for it. I faced a lot of scenarios where things breaks but service checks will be fine. Under such scenarios logs are the only hope. They have all these events captured.</p>

<p>At Plivo, we manage a variety of servers from SIP, Media, Proxy, WebServers, DB&#8217;s etc. Being a fully Cloud based system, i really wanted to have a system which can keep track of all the live events/status of what&#8217;s really happening inside our infra. So my plan was to collect two important stats, 1) Server&#8217;s events 2) Application events.</p>

<h4>Collectd and Logstash</h4>

<p><code>Collectd</code> is a daemon which collects system performance statistics periodically. Since we have a lot Server&#8217;s which handle Realtime Media, it&#8217;s a very critical component for us. We need to ensure that the server&#8217;s are not getting overloaded and there is no latency in network. I&#8217;ve been using Logstash heavily for stashing all my logs. And there is a stable input plugin for collectd to send the all the system metrics to logstash.</p>

<p>First we need to enable the Network Plugin, and then we need to mention our Logstash server IP and port so that collectd can start injecting metrics. Below is a sample colectd configuration.</p>

<pre><code>Hostname    "test.plivo.com"
Interval 10
Timeout 4
Include "/etc/collectd/filters.conf"
Include "/etc/collectd/thresholds.conf"
ReportStats true
    LogLevel info
LoadPlugin interface
LoadPlugin load
LoadPlugin memory
LoadPlugin network
&lt;Plugin interface&gt;
    Interface "eth0"
    IgnoreSelected false
&lt;/Plugin&gt;
&lt;Plugin network&gt;
    Server "{logstash_server_ip}" "logstash_server_port"    # if no port number is mentioned, it will take the default port number (25826)
&lt;/Plugin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now on the Logstash server, we need to add the CollectD plugin on to the input filter in the logstash&#8217;s config file.</p>

<pre><code>input {
      collectd {
      port =&gt; "5555"    # default port is 25826
      }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we are set. Based the plugins enabled in the collectd config file, collctd will start sending the metrics to Logstash on the Interval mentioned in the config, default is 10s. So in my case, i wanted the Load, CPU usage, Memory usage, Bandiwdth (TX and RX) etc. There are default plugins for all these metrics, which we can just enable it in the config file. We also had some custom plugins to collect some custom metrics. BTW writing custom plugin is pretty easy in Collectd.</p>

<p>Now using the Logstash&#8217;s Elasticsearch output plugin, we can keep these metrics in Elasticsearch. Now this where Kibana comes in. We can start visualizing these metrics via Kibana. We need to create a custom Lucene Query. Once we have the query, we can create a custom histogram&#8217;s for each of these queries. Below aresome sample Lucene queries that we can use with Kibana.</p>

<pre><code>For Load -&gt; collectd_type:"load" AND host:"test.plivo.com"
For Network usage -&gt; collectd_type:"if_octets" AND host:"test.plivo.com"
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the screenshot of  histogram for Load and Network (TX and RX)</p>

<p><img src="/images/collectd.png"></p>

<h5>Log Events</h5>

<p>Now next is to collect the events from the application logs. We use SIP protocol for all our VOIP sessions. So all our SIP server&#8217;s are very critical for us. SIP is pretty similar to HTTP. The response codes are very similar to HTTP responses, ie 1xx, 2xx, 3xx, 4xx, 5xx, 6xx. So i wrote some custom grok patterns so keep track of all of these responses and stores the same on the Elasticsearch.</p>

<p>The second stats which i was interested was our SIP registrar server. We provide SIP endpoints to our customers so that they can use the same with SIP/Soft phones. So i was more interested on stats like Number of registrations/sec, Auth error rates. Plus using ElasticSearch&#8217;s MAP facet&#8217;s i can create BetterMap. In my previous blog post&#8217;s i&#8217;ve mentioned on how to create these bettermaps using Kibana and Elasticsearch. Below bettermap screenshot shows us the SIP endpoint registrations from various locations in the last 2 hours.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bettermap.png"></p>

<p>Now using the Kibana we can start visualizing all these data&#8217;s. Below is a sample of Dashboard that i&#8217;ve created using Kibana.</p>

<p><img src="/images/event_logs.png"></p>

<p>ELK stack proved to be an amazing combination. We are currently injecting 3 million events every day and ElasticSearch was blazingly fast in indexing all theses.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Being in <em>DevOps</em> it&#8217;s always Multi tasking. From Regular customer queries it goes through Monitoring, Troubleshooting etc. And offcourse when things breaks, it really becomes core multi tasking. Especially when you have a really scaling infrastructure, we should really understand what&#8217;s really happening in our infrastructure. Yes we do have many new generation cloud monitoring tools like Sensu, but what if we have a near real time system that can tell us the each and every events happeing in our infrastructure. Logs are the best places where we can keep track of the events, even if the monitoring tools has missed it. We have a lot of log aggregator tools like tool Logstash, Splunk, Apache Kafka etc. And for log based event collection the common choice will be always <strong>Logstash -> StatsD -> Graphite</strong>. And ElasticSearch for indexing these.</p>

<p>My requirement was pretty straight. Record the events, aggregate them and keeps track of them in a timely manner. Kibana uses ElasticSearch facets for aggregating the search query results.Facets provide aggregated data based on a search query. So as a first task, i decided to visualize the location of user&#8217;s who are registering their SIP endpoints on our SIP registrar server. Kibana gives us a good interface for the 2D heat map as well as a new option called <em>BetterMap</em>. Bettermap uses geographic coordinates to create clusters of markers on map and shade them orange, yellow and green depending on the density of the cluster. So from the logs, i just extracted the register events, and used a custom regex patterns to extract the details like the Source IP, usernames etc using logstash. Using the logstash&#8217;s GeoIP filter, the Geo Locations of the IP can be identified. For the BetterMap, we need  coordinates, in geojson format. <em>GeoJSON</em> is <strong>[longitude,latitude]</strong> in an array. From the Geo Locations that we have identified in the GeoIP filter, we can create this GeoJSON for each event that we are receiving. Below is a sample code that i&#8217;ve used  in logstash.conf for creating the GeoJSON in Logstash.</p>

<pre><code>if [source_ip]  {
    geoip {
      type =&gt; "kamailio-registers"
      source =&gt; "source_ip"
      target =&gt; "geoip"
      add_field =&gt; ["[geoip][coordinates]","%{[geoip][longitude]}"]
      add_field =&gt; ["[geoip][coordinates]","%{[geoip][latitude]}"]
    }
    mutate {
      convert =&gt; [ "[geoip][coordinates]", "float" ]
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>The above filter will create a GeoJSON array &#8220;geoip.coordinates&#8221;. This array can be used for creating the BetterMap in Kibana. Below are the settings for creating a BetterMap panel in the Kibana dashboard. While adding a new panel, select &#8220;bettermap&#8221; as the panel type, and the co-ordinate filed should be the one which contains the GeoJSON data. Make sure that the data is of the format [longitude,latitude], ie Longitude first and then followed by latitude.</p>

<p><img src="/images/bettermap_config.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/bettermap.png"></p>

<p>Moving ahead, i decided to collect the events happening on our various other server&#8217;s. We were one of the earliest companies who started using SIP (Session Initiation Protocol). SIP employs design elements similar to the HTTP request/response transaction model. So similar to web traffic, i&#8217;ve decided to collect events related to 4XX, 5XX and 6XX error responses, as it is very important to us. Once the logs are shipped to logstash, i wrote another custom grok pattern, which extracts the Error Code and Error responses, including the server which returned the same. These data&#8217;s can be used for future analysis also. So i decided to store these on ElasticSearch. So now we have the real time event data&#8217;s stored, but how to visualize. Since i dont have to perform much mathematical analytics with data, i decided to to remove graphite. Kibana has a wonder full GUI for visualizing the data. So decided to go ahead with Kibana. One option is &#8220;histogram&#8221; panel time. Using histogram we can visualize the data via a regular bar graph, as well as using the area graph. There is another panel type called &#8220;terms&#8221; which can be used to display the agrregated events via pie chart, bar chart, or a table. And below is what i achieved with Kibana.</p>

<p><img src="/images/SIP-kibana.png"></p>

<p><img src="/images/SIP-pie.png"></p>

<p>This is just an inital setup. I&#8217;m going to add more events to this. As of now Kibana + Elasticsearch proves to be a promising combination for displaying all near real time events happening in my Infrastructure.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Being an OPS guy, i love Logs a lot. Logs contains lots of sensitive events recorded in it. Though a lot of people rely on monitoring tools, there are a lot of scenario where we still can&#8217;t rely on monitoring. In such scenarios, logs are the best sources to identify those events in a near real time fashion. A common scenario is Web Operations, where we need to count the the various 4xx, 5xx, Auth errors experienced by the user&#8217;s. I had a simliar requirement where i need to identify the 4xx, 5xx, 6xx errors and other similar failures on various SIP server&#8217;s. But apart from just visualising these error&#8217;s i also wanted a notification system which can notify me when the value crosses the threshold.</p>

<p><code>Logstash</code> and <code>StasD</code> is a perfect combination for aggregating events from the logs. StatsD has a Graphite backend, where it sends the aggreagated metric values for visualizing. But when we have large number graphs, and offcourse when being a multi tasking Ops guy, it&#8217;s not possible to sit and watch all these graphs. So we need a notification system which alert&#8217;s us when things starts breaking. Here comes <a href="http://riemann.io/">RIEMANN</a>. Riemann aggregates events from your servers and applications with a powerful stream processing language. Riemann is pretty light weight, easy to configure monitoring framework. Logstash sents the filtered events from the logs to StatsD output plugin. Based on the flushInterval, statsD iterates through the received events sents the aggregated metric values to the Graphite. There is also a Riemann output plugin for Logstash, but we need to pass the state/metric to the plugin. In my case, logstash filters the event from the log, so i need to converts these events to time based metric values. Since statsD already has these events converted into time series metrics, i decided to write a small backend for statsD that can send these aggregated metrics to Riemann.</p>

<p>The StatsD backend basically requires to main functions, one is &#8221;<em>flush_stats</em>&#8221; which will get invoked once the flush interval is reached. This function then iterates over the received metrics and passes these aggregated metrics to another function called &#8221;<em>post_stats</em>&#8221;, which sends the metrics to the corresponding aplications. In our case, we need to send the metrics to Riemann. There is a Riemann-Node plugin, which we can utilize here for sending the metrics to Riemann server. Below is the content for the &#8221;<em>flush_stats</em>&#8221; and &#8221;<em>post_stats</em>&#8221; functions. Currently i&#8217;ve added support only for counters. Soo i&#8217;ll be adding support for Counters and Timers also.</p>

<pre><code>flush_stats function
--------------------

var flush_stats = function riemann_flush(ts, metrics) {
var statString = '';
var numStats = 0;
var key;

var counters = metrics.counters;
var gauges = metrics.gauges;
var timers = metrics.timers;
var pctThreshold = metrics.pctThreshold;

for (key in counters) {
    var value = counters[key];
    var valuePerSecond = value / (flushInterval / 1000); // calculate "per second" rate

    statsString = value;
    service = key;
    time_stamp = ts;
    post_stats(statString, service_name, time_stamp);
}
}; 


post_stats function
-------------------

var post_stats = function riemann_post_metrics(statString, service_name, time_stamp) {

riemannStats.last_exception = Math.round(new Date().getTime() / 1000);

client.send(client.Event({
  service: service_name,
  metric:  statsString,
  time: time_stamp
}));
};
</code></pre>

<p>So here i&#8217;m not gonna send the per second metrics. I&#8217;m using the default 10 sec flushInterval. So every seconds StatsD will send the incremented metrics to Riemann. The namespace, sender etc are defined in the logstash conf itself. The full plugin file is available in <a href="https://gist.github.com/deepakmdass88/9851437">here</a></p>

<p>To use this Riemann backend, first we need to copy this file into the backend folder of the StatsD repo folder. Then we need to enable this plugin in the StatsD config file. Below is a sample config file which uses both graphite and Riemann backends.</p>

<pre><code>{
  riemannPort: 5555
, riemannHost: "localhost"
, graphitePort: 2003
, graphiteHost: "localhost"
, port: 8125
, backends: [ "./backends/riemann", "./backends/graphite" ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>So now StatsD will send out the incremented and the per second metric to Graphite and the Riemann backend will send the incremented metric to the Rieman server. No we can define the metric threshold and the notification method on the reimann config file. Below is my reimann metric threshold and notification.</p>

<pre><code>(streams
      (where (&gt;= metric 10)
        (where (service #"SIP")
          (email "deepakmdass88@gmail.com")))))
</code></pre>

<p>So whenever the recived metric value is beyond 10, Riemann will notify the same to my Email. I&#8217;ve done some dry testing with this setup. So far this setup never turned me down. Though there are some tweaks to be done, but this setup really suited to my requirement. being an OPS guy, my primary focus is to detect the outages at a very early stages to minimize the impact. Hope this guy will be an added defence layer for the same.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Instant messaging (IM) is a type of online chat which offers real-time text transmission over the Internet. Like XMPP, we can also use SIP for real-time text transmission. The Kamailio PRESENCE module helps us built the same locally. We can convert a simple Kamailio server into a full fledged IM server.</p>

<p>By default, all the registered endpoints will send a &#8220;PUBLISH&#8221; requests to the Presence server with their status and Presence server stores the status. Also the endpoints will send a &#8220;SUBSCRIBE&#8221; to other user&#8217;s status. For each &#8220;SUBSCRIBE&#8221; request, the Presence server will sent a &#8220;NOTIFY&#8221; request back with status of the user. This is how our UserAgent keeps track of each user&#8217;s status. Below is simple flow diagram for the same.</p>

<h3>Setting up Kamailio</h3>

<p>In my <a href="" title="http://beingasysadmin.wordpress.com/2014/02/23/integrating-kamailio-with-freeswitch/">previous blog</a>, i&#8217;ve explained how to install Kamailio from source. The only difference is we need to enable two more modules &#8221;<strong>presence</strong>&#8221; and &#8221;<strong>presence_xml</strong>&#8221;. If Kamailio is already installed, we need to add these two modules into <code>modules.lst</code> at the &#8221;<strong>include_modules</strong>&#8221; line. Once the module names are added, we need to run &#8221;<strong>make install</strong>&#8221; to install the two new modules. Once the module is added, we need to enable the module.</p>

<p>Add &#8220;#!define WITH_PRESENCE&#8221; into the &#8220;kamailio.cfg&#8221; file. Then check if there is route logic defined for the &#8220;PRESENCE&#8221; module. By default there is a PRESENCE route defined in the default &#8220;kamailio.cfg&#8221; file. If it&#8217;s not there below is the route logic. Also we need to add &#8220;*route(PRESENCE)<strong>&#8221; in the &#8221;</strong>request_route**&#8221; section.</p>

<pre><code># Presence server route
route[PRESENCE] {
        if(!is_method("PUBLISH|SUBSCRIBE"))
                return;

        if(is_method("SUBSCRIBE") &amp;&amp; $hdr(Event)=="message-summary") {
                route(TOVOICEMAIL);
                # returns here if no voicemail server is configured
                sl_send_reply("404", "No voicemail service");
                exit;
        }

#!ifdef WITH_PRESENCE
        if (!t_newtran())
        {
                sl_reply_error();
                exit;
        }

        if(is_method("PUBLISH"))
        {
                handle_publish();
                t_release();
        } else if(is_method("SUBSCRIBE")) {
                handle_subscribe();
                t_release();
        }
        exit;
#!endif

        # if presence enabled, this part will not be executed
        if (is_method("PUBLISH") || $rU==$null)
        {
                xlog("@ 404 here 3");
                sl_send_reply("404", "Not here");
                exit;
        }
        return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now start the Kamailio server. Now we need to add some users. For that we can use &#8221;<strong>kamctl</strong>&#8221; binary.</p>

<pre><code>$ kamctl add user1@192.168.56.100 user1

$ kamctl add user2@192.168.56.100 user2
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#8217;s go ahead and test the settings. For testing we need some IM clients. In my testing, i&#8217;ve used <strong>Jitsi</strong> and <strong>adium</strong> IM clients. Once the accounts are configured on the clients, it&#8217;s better to start a packet capture using wireshark, so that we can see these <strong>PUBLISH</strong>, <strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong> and <strong>NOTIFY</strong> requests between the clients and the Kamailio server. If you are using <strong>Adium</strong>, go to account options and check the &#8220;Publish Status to Everyone&#8221; so that it will start sending <strong>PUBLISH</strong> request to the Kamailio server. Now add the accounts to the Contact lists on the IM clients and then we will be able to see the users status (ONline/OFFline). Now we can start the chat conversation between the user&#8217;s.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><code>Kamailio</code> aka <code>OpenSER</code> is one of the most powerfull and popular Open Source SIP server. It can be used as <strong>SIP Proxy/Registrar/LB/Router</strong> etc. It also provides a lot of features <em>like WebSocket support for WebRTC, ; SIMPLE instant messaging and presence with embedded XCAP server and MSRP relay,IMS extensions,ENUM and offcourse AAA (accounting, authentication and authorization)</em> also. Kamailio is a modular system, ie, it has lot of modules which corresponds to particular functions. These modules can be easily installed and can be used easily in Kamailio. In this blog i&#8217;m going to use Kamailio as a proxy server. All the user&#8217;s are created in the Kamailio and FreeSwitch will be acting as a relay server for outbound calls. So Kamailio performs authentication and all the outbound calls wil be relayed to FreeSwitch.</p>

<h3>Installing Kamailio</h3>

<p>Lets download the latest version of Kamailio, now it&#8217;s 4.1</p>

<pre><code>$ wget http://www.Kamailio.org/pub/Kamailio/latest/src/Kamailio-4.1.1_src.tar.gz

$ tar xvzf Kamailio-4.1.1_src.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd Kamailio-4.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>Before we start the build we need to install the basic dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install gcc flex bison libmysqlclient-dev make libxml2-dev libssl-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have the dependencies installed, we can go ahead with the build.</p>

<pre><code>$ make cfg      # generates config files for build system
</code></pre>

<p>Now open <code>modules.lst</code> and add the modules to be installed in &#8221;<strong>include_modules</strong>&#8221; section. In my case i&#8217;m going to use MySQL backend so it will be &#8221;<strong>include_modules= db_mysql</strong>&#8221; and then we can run the &#8221;<em>make all</em>&#8221;. The other way is we can mention the modules directly while running the &#8220;make&#8221; rather editing the modules.lst file.</p>

<pre><code>$ make include_modules="db_mysql" cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can install,</p>

<pre><code>$ make install
</code></pre>

<p>The above command will install Kamailio to our system. There are four main binaries for Kamailio,</p>

<pre><code>Kamailio - Kamailio SIP server
kamdbctl - script to create and manage the Databases
kamctl - script to manage and control Kamailio SIP server
kamcmd - CLI - command line tool to interface with Kamailio SIP server
</code></pre>

<p>There is also one configuration file called &#8220;Kamailio.cfg&#8221; which is available by default at <code>/usr/local/etc/Kamailio/Kamailio.cfg</code></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go ahead with setting up MySQL server for Kamailio.</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install mysql-server
</code></pre>

<p>Now edit the <code>/usr/local/etc/Kamailio/kamctlrc</code> Locate DBENGINE variable and set it to MYSQL by making &#8221;<strong>DBENGINE=MYSQL</strong>&#8221;. Now we can use the &#8220;kamdbctl&#8221; binary to craete the default tables and users.</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/local/sbin/kamdbctl create
</code></pre>

<p>The script will add two users in MySQL:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kamailio - (with default password &#8216;Kamailiorw&#8217;) - user which has full access rights to &#8216;Kamailio&#8217; database</p></li>
<li><p>Kamailioro - (with default password &#8216;Kamailioro&#8217;) - user which has read-only access rights to &#8216;Kamailio&#8217; database</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There is a sample init.d script available along with Kamailio, which we can use it. We need to copy the sample init.d file to our system&#8217;s init.d folder. And the same for the system default file.</p>

<pre><code>$ cp /usr/local/src/Kamailio-4.1.1/pkg/Kamailio/deb/precise/Kamailio.init /etc/init.d/Kamailio

$ cp /usr/local/src/Kamailio-4.1.1/pkg/Kamailio/deb/precise/Kamailio.default /etc/default/Kamailio

$ chmod 755 /etc/init.d/Kamailio 
</code></pre>

<p>Edit the new init file and modify the $DAEMON and $CFGFILE values.</p>

<pre><code>DAEMON=/usr/local/sbin/Kamailio
CFGFILE=/usr/local/etc/Kamailio/Kamailio.cfg

$ mkdir -p /var/run/Kamailio    # Directory for the pid file
</code></pre>

<p>Default setting is to run Kamailio as user &#8221;<em>Kamailio</em>&#8221; and group &#8221;<em>Kamailio</em>&#8221;. For that we need to create the user:</p>

<pre><code>$ adduser --quiet --system --group --disabled-password \
      --shell /bin/false --gecos "Kamailio" \
      --home /var/run/Kamailio Kamailio

$ chown Kamailio:Kamailio /var/run/Kamailio
</code></pre>

<h3>Setting up Kamailio</h3>

<p>All the Kamailio configurations are mentioned in only one single file <code>/usr/local/etc/Kamailio/Kamailio.cfg</code>. All the logics are defined in this file, and Kamailio blindly executes this logics and perform the actions. It&#8217;s very important that the logics defined in the config should suit to our VOIP platform requirement.</p>

<p>First we need to enable the modules and the necessary features, so add the below lines in the Kamailio.cfg</p>

<pre><code>#!define WITH_MYSQL
#!define WITH_AUTH
#!define WITH_USRLOCDB
#!define WITH_FREESWITCH
</code></pre>

<p>We need to define the FreeSwitch server IP and port, for that we can add the below parameters in the &#8220;Custom Parameters&#8221; section.</p>

<pre><code>#!ifdef WITH_FREESWITCH
freeswitch.bindip = "192.168.56.100" desc "FreeSWITCH IP Address"
freeswitch.bindport = "5090" desc "FreeSWITCH Port"
#!endif
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can go ahead to the &#8221;<strong>request_route</strong>&#8221; section which performs the routing logic. Here i&#8217;m going to add two more routing logic for the FreeSwitch relay. After the &#8221;<strong>request_route</strong>&#8221; section, we can see the definition for each routing options. Below that we need to add our new route definitions.</p>

<pre><code>route[FSDISPATCH] {
        # dial number selection
        route(FSRELAY);
        exit;
}

route[FSRELAY] {
        $du = "sip:" + $sel(cfg_get.freeswitch.bindip) + ":" + $sel(cfg_get.freeswitch.bindport);
        if($var(newbranch)==1)
        {
                append_branch();
                $var(newbranch) = 0;
        }
        route(RELAY);
        exit;
}
</code></pre>

<p>By default, all the routes mentioned in the &#8220;request_route&#8221; will be executed line by line. There is a default route called &#8221;<strong>Location</strong>&#8221;, which splits the user part from the request URI and verifies if the user exists in the location table. But when we dial an outside number/user, this location check will fail, so i&#8217;m going to add a condition which checks if the user in the request URI contains a number with a length 9-15 will be relayed to the FreeSwitch. Again this is just a simple condition, we can create a more complex condition, like check the domain part, if the domain part contains a domain which doesnot belong to our Domain list, we can either decline the request, or we can relay to FreeSwitch or we can make DNS query and we can make Kamailio to process the request to that domain&#8217;s Proxy server. Like this we can define our own conditions in the config file, and Kamailio will execute it line by line.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to add my check condition on the &#8221;<strong>LOCATION</strong>&#8221; route definition.</p>

<pre><code>route[LOCATION] {

    #!ifdef WITH_SPEEDDIAL
        # search for short dialing - 2-digit extension
        if($rU=~"^[0-9][0-9]$")
                if(sd_lookup("speed_dial"))
                        route(SIPOUT);
    #!endif
        if($rU=~"^[0-9]{9,15}$")        # checking for numbers in the Request URI
                route(FSDISPATCH);
    #!ifdef WITH_ALIASDB
        # search in DB-based aliases
        if(alias_db_lookup("dbaliases"))
                route(SIPOUT);
    #!endif
        $avp(oexten) = $rU;
        if (!lookup("location")) {
                xlog("L_INFO", "CALL $rm $ci lookup here\n");
                xlog("L_INFO", "$fU@$fd - Lookup contact location for $rm\n");
                xlog("L_INFO", "rc is $var(rc)");
                switch ($rc) {
                        case -1:
                        case -3:
                                xlog("L_ERR", "$fU@$fd - No contact found\n");
                                send_reply("404", "Not Found here");
                                exit;
                        case -2:
                                send_reply("405", "Method Not Allowed");
                                exit;
                }
        }

        # when routing via usrloc, log the missed calls also
        if (is_method("INVITE"))
        {
                setflag(FLT_ACCMISSED);
        }
        xlog("L_INFO", "CALL $rm $ci relay\n");
        xlog("L_INFO", "$fU@$fd - Relaying $rm\n");
            route(RELAY);
        exit;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So now all the calls coming with numbers of length 9-15 in the Request URI will be relayed to the FreeSwitch, and FreeSwitch will process the call based on the DialPlan configured in the FreeSwitch. Since i&#8217;m going to use IP authentication, i need to whitelist the Kamailio ip in &#8220;acl_conf.xml&#8221; file in the FreeSwitch autload conf directory, so that FreeSwitch will accept the invites from Kamailio. Again i&#8217;m not defining any Voicemail options here. If we have a Voice mail server, then we can create another route option and when the caller doesn&#8217;t pick the call we can route the call to the Voice Mail server.
For example the below condition will route the failures to FreeSwitch Voice Mailbox.</p>

<pre><code>if(is_method("INVITE"))
        {
            # in case of failure - re-route to FreeSWITCH VoiceMail
            t_on_failure("FAIL_FSVBOX");        # where FSVBOX is a route definition
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Kamailio has a lot of modules which really comes in handy. For example we can use LDAP module to use LDAP as a backend. There is a PRESENCE module which helps us to setup an Instant Messaging server using Kamailio. I&#8217;ll be writing a blog on how to use Kamailio as an IM server soon. One of the main advantage of Kamailio over OpenSIP is the WebSocket support. This just a basic configuration, but we can design much complex system using Kamailio. We can even remove the default route logics, and we can use our own routing logics. Kamailio doesnot depend on default routing logics, it blindly reads the route and executes it for each incoming connections.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s more than a month since i joined the DevOps family at <strong>Plivo</strong>, since i&#8217;m pretty new to the Telecom Technology, i was digging more around it. This time i decided to play around with <strong>FreeSwitch</strong>, a free and open source communications software for the creation of voice and messaging products. Thanks to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anthony-minessale-ii/3a/403/942">Anthony Minessale</a> for designing and opensourcing such a powerfull powerfull application. FreeSwitch is well documented and there are pretty good blogs also available on how to setup a PBX using FreeSwitch. This time i&#8217;m going to explain on how to make a private Freeswitch server to use Plivo as a <em>SIP Trunking</em> service.</p>

<p>A bit about <a href="plivo.com">Plivo</a>. Plivo is a cloud based API Platform for building <em>Voice</em> and <em>SMS</em> enabled Applications. Plivo provides <strong>Application Programming Interfaces</strong> (APIs) to <em>make and receive calls, send SMS, make a conference call</em>, and more. These APIs are used in conjunction with XML responses to control the flow of a call or a message. We can create Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoints to perform the telephony operations and the APIs are platform independent and can be used in any programming environment such as PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. It also provides helper libraries for these programming languages.</p>

<p>First we need a valid Plivo account. Once we have the Plivo account, we can log into the Plivo Cloud service. Now go to the &#8221;<strong>Endpoints</strong>&#8221; tab and create a SIP endpoint and attach a DirectDial app to it. Once this is done we can go ahead and start setting up the FreeSwitch instance.</p>

<h3>Installing FreeSwitch</h3>

<p>Clone the Official FreeSwitch Github and Repo and compile from the source.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone git://git.freeswitch.org/freeswitch.git &amp;&amp; cd freeswitch

$ ./bootstrap.sh &amp;&amp; ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/freeswitch

$ make &amp;&amp; make install

$  make all cd-sounds-install cd-moh-install    # optional, run this if you want IVR and Music on Hold features
</code></pre>

<p>Now if we have more than one ip address on the machine, and if we want to bind to a particular ip, we need to modify two files &#8221;<em>/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/sip_profiles/external.xml</em>&#8221; and &#8221;<em>/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/sip_profiles/internal.xml</em>&#8221;. In both the files, change the parameters &#8221;<strong>name=&#8221;rtp-ip&#8221;</strong>&#8221; and &#8221;<strong>param name=&#8221;sip-ip&#8221;</strong>&#8221; with the <em>bind ip</em> as the values.</p>

<p>By default, Freeswitch will create a set of users, which includes numerical usernames ie, 1000-1019. So we can test the basic connectivity between user&#8217;s by making a call between two user accounts. We can register two of the accounts in two SoftPhones and we can make a test call and make sure that FreeSwitch is working fine. We can use the FS binary file to start FreeSwitch service in forground.</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/local/freeswitch/bin/freeswitch
</code></pre>

<h3>Configuring Gateway</h3>

<p>Once the FreeSwitch is working fine, we can start configuring the SIP trunking via Plivo. So first we need to create an external gateway to connect to Plivo. I&#8217;m going to use the SIP endpoint created on the Plivo Cloud to initiate the connection. The SIP domain for Plivo is &#8221;<strong>phone.plivo.com</strong>&#8221;. We need to create a gateway config. Go to &#8221;<em>/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/sip_profiles/external/</em>&#8221;, here we can create an XML gateway config file. My config file name is <strong>plivo</strong>. Below is the content for the same.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;include&gt;
  &lt;gateway name="plivo"&gt;
  &lt;param name="realm" value="phone.plivo.com" /&gt;
  &lt;param name="username" value="test88140105181635" /&gt;
  &lt;param name="password" value="secret" /&gt;
  &lt;param name="register" value="false" /&gt;
  &lt;param name="ping" value="5" /&gt;
  &lt;param name="ping-max" value="3" /&gt;
  &lt;param name="retry-seconds" value="5" /&gt;
  &lt;param name="expire-seconds" value="60" /&gt;
  &lt;variables&gt;
        &lt;variable name="verbose_sdp" value="true"/&gt;
  &lt;/variables&gt;
  &lt;/gateway&gt;
&lt;/include&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There are a lot of other parameters which we can add it here, like caller id etc. Replace the username and password with the Plivo endpoint credentials. If we want to keep this endpoint registered, we can set the register param as true and we can set the expiry time at expire-seconds, so that the Fs will keep on registering the Endpoint with Plivo&#8217;s Registrar server. once the gateway file is created, we can either restart the service or we can run &#8220;reload mod_sofia&#8221; on the FScli. If the FreeSwitch service si started in foreground, we will get the FScli, so we can run the reload command directly on it.</p>

<h3>Setting up Dialplan</h3>

<p>Now we have the Gateway added. Now we need to the setup the Dial Plan to route the outgoing calls through Plivo. Go to &#8221;<em>/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/dialplan/</em>&#8221; folder and add an extension on the &#8221;<strong>public.xml</strong>&#8221; file. Below is a sample extension config.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;extension name="Calls to Plivo"&gt;
      &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^(&lt;ur_regex_here&gt;)$"&gt;
        &lt;action application="transfer" data="$1 XML default"/&gt;
      &lt;/condition&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So now all calls matching to the Regex will be transferred to the default dial plan. Now on the the default dial plan, i&#8217;m creating an exntension and will use the FreeSwitch&#8217;s &#8221;<em>bridge</em>&#8221; application to brdige the call with Plivo using the Plivo Gateway. So on the &#8221;<em>default.xml</em>&#8221; add the below extension.</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;extension name="Dial through Plivo"&gt;
         &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^(&lt;ur_regex_here&gt;)$"&gt;
           &lt;action application="bridge" data="sofia/gateway/plivo/$1"/&gt;
         &lt;/condition&gt;
       &lt;/extension&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can restart the FS service or we can reload &#8220;mod_dialplan_xml&#8221; from the FScli. Once the changes are into effect, we can test whether the call is getting routed via Plivo. Configure a soft phone with a default FS user and make an outbound call which matches the regex that we have mentioned for routing to Plivo. Now if all works we should get a call on the destination number. We can check the FS logs at &#8221;<em>/usr/local/freeswitch/log/freeswitch.log</em>&#8221;.</p>

<p>If the Regex is matched, we can see the below lines in the log.</p>

<pre><code>1f249a72-9abf-4713-ba69-c2881111a0e8 Dialplan: sofia/internal/1001@192.168.56.11 parsing [public-&gt;Calls from BoxB] continue=false

</code></pre>

<p>We can also mention the CallerID on the Direct Dial app which we have mapped to the SIP endpoint. Now for Incoming calls, create a app that can forward the calls to one of the user&#8217;s present in the FreeSwitch, using the Plivo&#8217;s Dial XML. So the XML should look something like below. I will be writing a more detailed blog about Inbound calls once i&#8217;ve have tested it out completely.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Response&gt;
  &lt;Dial&gt;
    &lt;User&gt;FSuser@FSserverIP&lt;/User&gt;
  &lt;/Dial&gt;
&lt;/Response&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But for security, we need to allow connections from Plivo server. So we need to allow those IP&#8217;s on the FS acl. We can allow the IP&#8217;s in the &#8221;<strong>acl.conf.xml</strong>&#8221; file at &#8221;<em>/usr/local/freeswitch/conf/autoload_configs</em>&#8221;. And make sure that the FS server is accessible via a public ip atleast for the Plivo server&#8217;s which will forward the calls.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been using <code>HipChat</code> for the last one month. Before that it was IRC always. But when i joined <em>Plivo&#8217;s</em> <strong>DevOps</strong> family, i&#8217;ve got a lot of places to integrate plivo to automate a lot of stuffs. This i was planning to do some thing with Hipchat. There are a couple of HipChat bot&#8217;s available, i decided to use &#8217;<strong>robut</strong>&#8217;, as it is simple, written in Ruby and easy to write plugins also. Robut need only one &#8220;Chatfile&#8221; as its config file. All the Hip Chat account and room details are mentioned in this file. The Plugins are enabled in this file.</p>

<p>First we need to clone the repository.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/justinweiss/robut.git
</code></pre>

<p>Now i need &#8217;<strong>redis</strong>&#8217; and &#8217;<strong>plivo</strong>&#8217; gems for my new plugin. So need to add the same in the Gemfile. Once the gems are added in to the Gemfile, we need to do a &#8221;<strong>bundle install</strong>&#8221; to install all the necessary gems. The path for the <code>Chatfile</code> can be mentioned in  &#8221;<strong>bin/robut</strong>&#8221; file. Now before starting <strong>robut</strong> we need to add the basic HipChat settings ie, <em>jabberid, nick, password and room</em>. Now wen eed to create a plugin to use with robut. The default plugins are available in &#8221;<em>lib/robut/plugin/</em>&#8221; folder. Below is the plugin which i created for making  Text To Speech calls.</p>

<pre><code>require 'json'
require 'timeout'
require 'securerandom'
require 'plivo'
require 'redis'

class Robut::Plugin::Call
  include Robut::Plugin

  def usage
    "#{at_nick} call &lt;number&gt; &lt;message&gt; "
  end

  def handle(time, sender_nick, message)
    new_msg = message.split(' ')
    if sent_to_me?(message) &amp;&amp; new_msg[1] == 'call'
    num = new_msg[2]
    textt = message.split(' ').drop(3).join(' ')
      begin
    reply("Calling #{num}")
    plivo_auth_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    plivo_auth_token = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    uuid = SecureRandom.hex
        r = Redis.new(:host =&gt; "redis_host", :port =&gt; redis_port, :password =&gt; "redis_port")
        temp = {
               'text' =&gt; "#{textt}"
               }
    plivo_number = "plivo_number"
        to_number = "#{num}"
        answer_url = "http://polar-everglades-1062.herokuapp.com/#{uuid}"

        call_params = {
                      'from' =&gt; plivo_number,
                      'to' =&gt; to_number,
                      'answer_url' =&gt; answer_url,
                      'answer_method' =&gt; 'GET'
                      }
        r.set "#{uuid}", temp.to_json
        r.expire "#{uuid}", 3000
        sleep 5
        puts "Initiating plivo call"
    p = Plivo::RestAPI.new(plivo_auth_id, plivo_auth_token)
        details = p.make_call(call_params)
    reply("Summary #{details}")
      rescue
        reply("Can't calculate that.")
      end
    end
  end
end

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s almost 2 weeks since i&#8217;ve joined <a href="http://plivo.com/">Plivo&#8217;s</a> DevOps family. I was spending a lot of time on understanding their API&#8217;s as i&#8217;m new to telephony. Plivo&#8217;s <a href="http://plivo.com/docs/api/">API</a> made telephony so easy that even a person with basic programming language can built powerfull telephony apps to suit to their infrastructure. So when i started playing around with the API, i decided to take it to a different level. I&#8217;m strong lover of Sensu Monitoring tool, so i decided to integrate <em>Plivo</em> with <em>Sensu</em> to built a new Notification system using the Phone call. Many people rely on Pagerduty for the same feature. But that part is completly managed by PagerDuty, where in for the alerts which we sent to PagerDuty, they will notify us via phone call to the phone numbers mentioned on Pager Duty. So i decided to built a similar Handler to Sensu, so that we can have a similar feature on Sensu. In this blog i will explain how i achieved the same with Plivo Framework.</p>

<p><code>Plivo</code> provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to make and receive calls, send SMS, make a conference call, and more. These APIs are used in conjunction with XML responses to control the flow of a call or a message. Developers can create Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) endpoints to perform the telephony operations and the APIs are platform independent and can be used in any programming environment such as PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. It also provides helper libraries for these programming languages.</p>

<p>Here the Sensu will be initiating outbound calls using Plivo&#8217;s <a href="http://plivo.com/docs/api/">Call</a> API, to the required numbers and will read out the Alert using Plivo&#8217;s Text to Speech Engine. First we need an account on Plivo Cloud, we can go to <a href="https://manage.plivo.com/accounts/register/">SignUP</a> page, and need to create an account. By using the default, we can make test calls. But for longer usage, i will suggest to buy some credits for using the service extensively. Once we login with credentials, at the dashboard we can see <strong><em>Plivo AuthID</em></strong> and <strong><em>Plivo AuthToken</em></strong>, which is required to access Plivo&#8217;s API. Now for making out bound calls, we need to use the <a href="http://plivo.com/docs/api/call/">Call</a> API. We also need to provide an &#8221;<strong>answer_url</strong>&#8221; which contains XML instructions to direct the progress of the call. Plivo will fetch the &#8221;<strong>answer_url</strong>&#8221; and executes te XML instructions. So here i will be using <em>Sinatra</em> to create a web app that will returns the XML.  The main challenge is the text to be mentioned in the XML need to retrieved from the alert. So we cannot predefine the text as well as the request url, because it will be in dynamic in nature.</p>

<p><code>Solution</code> :- Here i&#8217;m going to use a publically accessible <em>Redis</em> server which is protected with a password. When Sensu handler receives the alert, it will create a hash from the alert received with a random UUID as the name of the hash. And the same UUID will be used as the request path for the answer_url. And when sinatra recieves a request, by default the requested path wont be existing in the sinatra&#8217;s config file, as it&#8217;s a dynamically generated. So by default Sinatra will return a 404 response. But in Sinatra, there is an option called &#8221;<strong><em>not_found</em></strong>&#8221;, where we can customize the response instead of returning 404 directly. So i will be using the &#8220;not_found&#8221; option and instead of directly returing a 404, i will make sinatra to talk to my redis server. Since the UUID can be fetched from the request URL, and the same is used in the redis as the name of the Hash, Sinatra can get the details of the alert from the Redis. These details are then used to create the XML and will be returned as the response to Plivo. It will be better to go through Plivo&#8217;s API documentation to understand more about the XML responses and outbound calls.</p>

<p>For those who don&#8217;t have a dedicated server to host the Sinatra app and Redis server, <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-ruby">heroku</a> can be used to host the Sinatra app. We can also use the redis addon availabe at the Heroku for our usage.</p>

<h2>Sinatra App</h2>

<p>Below is the code for the Sinatra app. The &#8221;<strong><em>not_found</em></strong>&#8221; option is the one which performs the connection with the Redis.</p>

<pre><code>require 'plivo'
require 'sinatra'
require 'redis'
require 'rest_client'

get '/' do
  play_loop = 1
  lang = "en-US"
  voice = "WOMAN"
  text = "Congratulations! You just made a text to speech app on Plivo cloud!"
  @path = request.path
  puts @path
  speak_params = {
                     'loop' =&gt; play_loop,
                     'language' =&gt; lang,
                     'voice' =&gt; voice,
                     }

  plivo = Plivo::Speak.new(text, speak_params)

  response = Plivo::Response.new()
  response.add(p)
  return response.to_xml
end

not_found do
  @path = request.path
  keyword = @path[1..-1]
  response = Redis.new(:host =&gt; "&lt;redis_host_name&gt;", :port =&gt; &lt;redis_port&gt;, :password =&gt; "&lt;redis_pass&gt;")
  data_red = response.get("#{keyword}")
  if data_red == nil
         return "404 Not Found"
  else
         data = JSON.parse(response.get("#{keyword}"))
         text = data["text"]
         play_loop = 1
         lang = "en-US"
         voice = "WOMAN"
         speak_params = {
                        'loop' =&gt; play_loop,
                        'language' =&gt; lang,
                        'voice' =&gt; voice,
                        }

         plivo = Plivo::Speak.new(text, speak_params)

         response = Plivo::Response.new()
         response.add(p)
         return r.to_xml
   end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The above app will redirect all the non found requests and make a requests to the Redis server using the request.path as the name of the hash. If there is a valid hash table, it will generate a Plivo XML else it will return &#8220;404 Not Found&#8221;.</p>

<h2>Plivo Handler</h2>

<p>Below is the Plivo Handler code. this is the Initial code, need to be tweaked to suit to the Sensu&#8217;s coding standard. Also the settings option need to be added so that all the parameters can be provided in the JSON file of the Handler. But as of now, this handler has been tested with Sensu and it is working perfectly fine.</p>

<pre><code>require 'rubygems'
require 'sensu-handler'
require 'timeout'
require 'securerandom'
require 'plivo'
require 'redis'
require 'timeout'


class PLIVO &lt; Sensu::Handler

  def short_name
    @event['client']['name'] + '/' + @event['check']['name']
  end

  def action_to_string
    @event['action'].eql?('resolve') ? "RESOLVED" : "ALERT"
  end

  def handle
    plivo_auth_id = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"          # =&gt; available at the plivo dashboard
    plivo_auth_token = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"       # =&gt; available at the plivo dashboard
    body = &lt;&lt;-BODY.gsub(/^ {14}/, '')
            #{@event['check']['output']}
            Host: #{@event['client']['name']}
           BODY
    uuid = SecureRandom.hex
    r = Redis.new(:host =&gt; "&lt;redis_host_name&gt;", :port =&gt; &lt;redis_port&gt;, :password =&gt; "&lt;redis_pass&gt;")
    temp = {
            'text' =&gt; "#{body}"
            }
    plivo_number = "&lt;YOUR PLIVO NUMBER"
    to_number = "&lt;DESTINATION NUMBER&gt;"
    answer_url = "&lt;YOUR HEROKU APP URL&gt;/#{uuid}"
    call_params = {
                     'from' =&gt; plivo_number,
                     'to' =&gt; to_number,
                     'answer_url' =&gt; answer_url,
                     'answer_method' =&gt; 'GET'
                     }
         r.set "#{uuid}", temp.to_json
         r.expire "#{uuid}", &lt;EXPIRY TTL&gt;
         sleep 5
     begin
       timeout 10 do
         puts "Connecting to Plivo Cloud.."
         plivo = Plivo::RestAPI.new(plivo_auth_id, plivo_auth_token)
     details = plivo.make_call(call_params)
       end
       rescue Timeout::Error
       puts "timed out while attempting to contact Plivo Cloud"
         end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The above handler will make an outbound call to the Destination number and plivo&#8217;s text to speech engine will read out the Alert summary on the call. Now If you want to call multiple user&#8217;s, simply create an array or hash with the contact numbers and iterate over it.</p>

<p>This handler will give us the same feature of Phone Call notification similar to Pager Duty. We just need to pay for the phone call usage. Dedicated to all those who wants an affordable yet a good notification system with Sensu. I will be merging out my code soon to the  sensu-community repository.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><code>Twitter</code> has become one of the powerfull social networking site. And people do share a lot of good info&#8217;s here. Even people reports outages of various sites and services in Twitter. Many of the tech companies do have a valid accounts to keep track of user&#8217;s comments on their  services/products and they even interacts with user&#8217;s. Website&#8217;s like &#8220;downrightnow.com&#8221;, uses Twitter as an information source to identify the outage of many famous websites and services. Even in our personal site&#8217;s we use Javascripts to  display our tweets and other statuses. But since the Twitter API version 1.1, which needs ouath, many of the jquery plugins became obsolete. This time i got a requirement to built a system that keeps track of tweets based on custom keywords. But i wanted to shaw all the tweets in a category basis, but on a sinlge page, with some scrolling effects, at the same time the sroller should keeps on updating with tweets on a regular interval basis. Which means i&#8217;m more concerned about the new trends going on in the Twitter.</p>

<p>Since i&#8217;m a <em>Rubyist</em>, i decided to build a Ruby app with <strong>Sinatra</strong> web Frontend, one my favourite web frameworks. I&#8217;m hard lover of Redis, faster since it runs on ram, and i dont want to keep my old tweets. So, My app is pretty simple, there will a <strong>Feeder</strong> which will talk to Twitter&#8217;s API and get the Tweet&#8217;s these tweet&#8217;s will be then stored in Redis, The Sinatra Fronend will fetch the tweets, and will display it in a scrolling fashion on the front end. Since i&#8217;m a CLI junkie, i&#8217;m not familiar with HTMLs and UI&#8217;s, so i decided to go with <em>Twitter Bootstrap</em> to build the HTML pages.</p>

<p>There is a Ruby gem called &#8221;<strong>TweetStream</strong>&#8221; which works very well with Twitter API v1.1. So i&#8217;m going to use this gem to talk to Twitter. Below is the simple architecture diagram for my app.</p>

<p><img src="/images/tweetgrabber.png"></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see each components in detail.</p>

<h3>Feeder</h3>


<p><code>Feeder</code> is a ruby script which constantly talks to Twitter API and grabs the latest streaming tweets based on the search keywords. Add all the grabbed tweets are then stored into the Redis database. Since i&#8217;ve to display teets corresponding to each keyword in separate scrolling fashions, i&#8217;m using separate redis database for each. So the Feeder has multiple ruby methods, where each method will be used  for each keyword and writes into the corresponding Redis DB. Below is one of the Ruby Method in the Feeder script.</p>

<pre><code>                        #######  FEEDER ####### 

TweetStream.configure do |config|
  config.consumer_key       = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'          =&gt; All these cosnumerkey,secret and oauth tokens have to be generated from
  config.consumer_secret    = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'             the Twitter's API site, dev.twitter.com
  config.oauth_token        = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  config.oauth_token_secret = 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
  config.auth_method        = :oauth
end

def tweet_general
  TweetStream::Client.new.track('opensource') do |status|   =&gt;  Thiss Tweatstream client will keep tracking the keyword "opensource"
    if ( status.lang == 'en' )
      push(
                'id' =&gt; status[:id],
               'text' =&gt; status.text,
               'username' =&gt; status.user.screen_name,

<h3>Redis DB</h3>


<p>In Redis, im going to use the <strong>LIST</strong> data type. LIST are simply list of strings, sorted by insertion order. It is possible to add elements to a Redis List pushing new elements on the head (on the left) or on the tail (on the right) of the list.</p>

<p><img src="/images/redis-list.png"></p>

<p>So the new tweets i will be pushing in from the head, and prevent the over population, i will be calling <em>LTRIM</em> operation preiodically to clear of the old tweets from the database. All these operations are done from the Feeder by corresponding ruby methods/functions.</p>

<h3>Sinatra Frontend</h3>


<p>I&#8217;m using <strong>SINATRA</strong> for building the frontend. SInce i&#8217;m not much familiar with HTML&#8217;s and UI&#8217;s, i decided to use <em>Twitter Bootstrap</em> for building the layout. And for each category, i&#8217;ve created a collapsible table, so that we can expand and collapse the required tables. Now, the next task is scrolling the tweets, for that i found a jquery plugin called <a href="https://github.com/buildinternet/totem">Totem Ticker</a>.ANd i enabled, refreshing for the div element which contains this scroller, so that after each refresh, the variable which supplies tweets to the scroller, will get updated with the newer tweets from the corresponding Redis DB.</p>

<p><img src="/images/layout.png"></p>

<p>As of now the app is working fine. But i&#8217;m planning to extend this to add more features, like adding the keywords dynamically from the Web Frontend, and displaying only those tables with the keywords. I will be digging more take it more powerfull :-). I&#8217;m going to push the working code soon into my GitHub account, so that others can also paly around on this, and can extend it for their own requirements.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><code>CouchDB</code> is an open source <em>NoSQL</em> database, which comes with a powerfull <strong>Rest API</strong>. It stores data in <em>JSON format</em>. uses <em>Javascripts</em> as its query language using <em>MapReduce</em>. JSON data&#8217;s are very easy to understand and can be parsed very easily. This time i got a requirement to build a commandline utility to display results for an internal monitoring tool. The tool is a bit old, and it does not have any api. And finding latest the result is consuming more time using the front end. But one advantage was the frontend can display results in HTML and XML. So curl was able to query the server using the url and it can display the xml output. The url is unique for each, as it composed of few details like Location, SerialNo, Domain, OS etc, which is unique for each hosts. So i decided to have a local database which contains all these unique host details. For this purpose, i dont need any relational databases, and NoSQL databases are sufficient. So i decided to use CouchDB, because it comes with a wonderfull rest api.</p>

<p>Since i&#8217;m a <em>RUBY</em> lover, i decided to use this couchdb ruby <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Getting_started_with_Ruby">wrapper</a>. SInce my requirement with CouchDB was pretty simple, this wrapper itself was sufficient for me. This wrapper can be used to perform any operations like, reading,writing,deleting Documents as well as Databases. This wrapper basically uses the ruby http library to talk to the CouchDB&#8217;s rest api.  By default couchdb is available in most of the Linux respositories. for windows and mac, the files are available in the CouchDB website itself.</p>

<p>for example, for ubuntu/debian, below command will install couchdb server.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install couchdb -y
</code></pre>

<p>By default, the couchDB package comes with a web frontend called &#8220;Futon&#8221; which can be accessed via browsers ugin the below url,</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:5984/_utils/
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the screenshot of the Futon frontend.</p>

<p><img src="/images/futon.png"></p>

<p>We can perform all the operations through this web interface also. So i created a database, and created a document for each host with required fields. Now these documents can be accessed via the rest api in JSON format. so that my ruby script can fetch all the necessary data and can compose the exact url for fetching the check results for corresponding hosts.</p>

<p>Below is a sample read operation that we can perform through our ruby scripts. But before using the operation, we need to include the wrapper into our script. For that we need to add &#8216;require ./couch.rb&#8217;, we can use both relative or absolute path. once the wrapper is included,we can start performing operations with the CouchDB.</p>

<pre><code>server = Couch::Server.new("localhost", "5984")
res = server.get("/foo/document_id")
json = res.body
puts json
</code></pre>

<p>The operation will read the document and will convert it into JSON using the json ruby library. Now i can use the JSON data to collect the required fields so that my script can form the exact fetch url for each host and can perform the result fetch.  There is couchdb <a href="https://github.com/phifty/couchdb">gem</a> for ruby, which can perform more operations.</p>

<p>Apart from this, CouchDB has another important feature &#8221;<strong>MAPREDUCE</strong>&#8221;, yes it can perform <strong>MapReduce</strong>, i&#8217;m trying to find if mapreduce can help me, so that i can extend my app to do more things. Once if i get any weird idea with MapReduce i will udapte this blog with that also.</p>
