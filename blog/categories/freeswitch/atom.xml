    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>Docker</code> is a very powerfull tool for managing Linux containers. In my previous <a href="http://beingasysadmin.wordpress.com/2014/06/16/dockerizing-freeswitch-docker-enters-telephony-world/">blog</a> i've explaind on how to setup a Docker Freeswitch. Docker is very mature now, version 1.0 has already been released. Docker is now supported by all major cloud vendors. Docker was showing promising results when i was performing my initial testing. So this time i decided to perform a heavy load test on the Freeswitch container to ensure that Docker can really enter Telephony. Like any normal sys admin, i was googling for Freeswitch load test, and most of the results were pointing to Sipp, an Open Source test tool / traffic generator for the SIP protocol. For me Sipp didnt helped me as it started throwing errors beyond 320 simultaneous calls. The UDP connections were timing out. I tried increasing the timeout, which didn't helped much.</p>

<p>So next choice is to use a Freeswitch itself, to generate calls. Using the FreeSwitch's <em>originate</em> command to generate simultaneous calls and hit the Docker Freeswitch container. I also decided to collect all system metrics, so that i knows how the machine behaves under various load tests conditions. For this i deciced to use <em>CollectD</em> and <em>Graphite</em> combo. Collectd 5+ has an inbuild graphite plugin which can send the collectd metrics to a graphite server.</p>

<p>I've already setup an Ubuntu-Freeswitch Docker <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/deepakmdass88/fs-ubuntu/">image</a>. First we need to pull the images from the Docker hub.</p>

<pre><code>$ docker pull deepakmdass88/fs-ubuntu
</code></pre>

<p>Now i'm going to start the Docker FreeSwitch container in foreground.</p>

<pre><code>$ docker run --rm --privilieged -i -t -p 5060:5060/tcp -p 5060:5060/udp -p 16384:16384/udp -p 16385:16385/udp -p 16386:16386/udp -p 16387:16387/udp -p 16388:16388/udp -p 16389:16389/udp -p 16390:16390/udp -p 16391:16391/udp -p 16392:16392/udp -p 16393:16393/udp -p 5080:5080/tcp -p 5080:5080/udp deepakmdass88/fs-ubuntu /bin/bash
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>privilieged</code> option was enabled because, the FreeSwitch init script sets some custom <strong>ulimit</strong> values, so the container has to be given special privileges. Corresponding SIP and RTP ports are forwarded from the host to the container.</p>

<p>Now before starting the Freeswitch service, we can set up the CollectD agent. By default, the Ubuntu repostiry contains CollectD versio 4.10, but the Graphite plugin is available from version 5.0+ onwards. So we can use somne PPA which has the corresponding version available.</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install python-software-properties

$ add-apt-repository ppa:joey-imbasciano/collectd5

$ apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install collectd
</code></pre>

<p>Now in the <code>/etc/collectd.conf</code>, uncomment <em>LoadPlugin write_graphite</em>. Also, in the same file and uncomment the plugin definition and fill in the server details.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Plugin write_graphite&gt;
  &lt;Carbon&gt;
        Host "dockergraphite.example.com"
        Port "2003"
        Protocol "tcp"
        LogSendErrors true
        Prefix "collectd."
        StoreRates true
        AlwaysAppendDS false
        EscapeCharacter "_"
  &lt;/Carbon&gt;
&lt;/Plugin&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I've enabled a custom <a href="https://github.com/ReadyTalk/freeswitch-collectd-plugin">freeswitch</a> plugin, which will extract the current ongoing calls count from freeswitch and sends it to the graphite server. Once the config changes are done we can restart the CollectD service. Now we can check our graphite UI to see if the default metrics like memory, load, cpu etc. are reaching the graphite server. Once CollectD-Graphite setup is ready, we can go ahead with our load test. So, once the call has reached the server, we need some <em>Dialplan</em> to continue the calls. So the simplest method is to create an infinite loop of playing some file, or some conference. Below are some dialplans that i've created in the <code>public.xml</code></p>

<pre><code># Infinite Play Loop

 &lt;extension name="111222333"&gt;
       &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^111222333$"&gt;
         &lt;action application="answer"/&gt;
         &lt;action application="playback" data="sounds/music/8000/got.wav"/&gt;
         &lt;action application="transfer" data="111222333 XML public"/&gt;
       &lt;/condition&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;

# Test conference

  &lt;extension name="docker-fs-test-conf"&gt;
    &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^112233"&gt;
      &lt;action application="answer"/&gt;
      &lt;action application="sleep" data="500"/&gt;
      &lt;action application="conference" data="docker-test@public"/&gt;
    &lt;/condition&gt;
  &lt;/extension&gt;


# Default IVR menu

    &lt;extension name="ivr_demo"&gt;
      &lt;condition field="destination_number" expression="^5000$"&gt;
        &lt;action application="answer"/&gt;
        &lt;action application="sleep" data="2000"/&gt;
        &lt;action application="ivr" data="demo_ivr"/&gt;
      &lt;/condition&gt;
    &lt;/extension&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we have the dialplans ready, next is authentication. By default there are two ways, Digest auth and IP Whitelist. Here i'm going to use IP whitelist, so we need to whitelist our IP in the acl.conf file.</p>

<pre><code> &lt;list name="domains" default="deny"&gt;
      &lt;!-- domain= is special it scans the domain from the directory to build the ACL --&gt;
      &lt;node type="allow" domain="$${domain}"/&gt;
      &lt;node type="allow" cidr="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/32"/&gt;                 # IP of FS from which we are going to send the calls
      &lt;!-- use cidr= if you wish to allow ip ranges to this domains acl. --&gt;
      &lt;!-- &lt;node type="allow" cidr="192.168.0.0/24"/&gt; --&gt;
 &lt;/list&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can start the Freeswitch service.</p>

<pre><code>$ /etc/init.d/freeswitch start
</code></pre>

<p>We can check the freeswich service using the fs_cli command.</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/local/freeswitch/bin/fs_cli -x "show status"

UP 0 years, 0 days, 6 hours, 34 minutes, 59 seconds, 648 milliseconds, 56 microseconds
FreeSWITCH (Version 1.5.13b git 39200cd 2014-07-02 21:55:21Z 64bit) is ready
1068 session(s) since startup
0 session(s) - peak 299, last 5min 0
0 session(s) per Sec out of max 30, peak 29, last 5min 0
1000 session(s) max
min idle cpu 0.00/100.00
Current Stack Size/Max 240K/8192K
</code></pre>

<p>Now freeswitch is ready to accept the connection. We can start sending the calls from our Load test freeswitch. Below is the script that was used to originate the calls from the load test Freeswitch machine. This will create simultaneous calls towards the Docker FS.</p>

<pre><code>IP_URI="sip:111222333@&lt;docker-fs-ip&gt;:5060"
MAX_CALLS=$1

while [ 1 ]; do

set -i req
req=$(/usr/local/freeswitch/bin/fs_cli -q -b -x "show channels count" | awk '{print $1}')
if [ $req -lt $MAX_CALLS ]; then
    /usr/local/freeswitch/bin/fs_cli -q -b -x "bgapi originate sofia/external/$SIP_URI loadtest"
else
    echo "sleep a bit ..."
    sleep 10s

fi
</code></pre>

<p>While bulk calls are being made from the Load test freeswitch machines, to test the Quality in real time, it's better to dial to the extension directly from a Sip Phone/Client and ensure that voice quality is good. Below is my Graphite dashboard for the load test.</p>

<p>Default Graphite UI</p>

<p><img src="/images/Docker-FS-Loadtest.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/urbanairship/tessera">Tessera</a> UI</p>

<p><img src="/images/tessera-graphite.png"></p>

<p>The FS was stable till 500 simultaneous calls, after that there was a sudden drop in calls and also the voice quality started dropping and in a minute the Freeswitch crashed due to Segmentation fault. I'm  going to analyze the core dump file to understand more about the crash. The other smaller drops that we see in the graph was caused by the Load test Freeswitch machine, as the load was getting high when the number of calls was increased. But 500 simultaneous calls are pretty decent and the there was no issue in voice quality till the number of calls crossed 500. Though it's very difficult to make a final confirmation, i decided to go ahead with phase 2 load test.</p>

<p>In the phase 2 test, i'm planning to use multiple FS load test machines to generate large simultaneous calls + running 2 separate FS containers on the same host and split the incoming calls to both these containers. Once the phase 2 test is completed, ill share the test results in an another blog post. Docker is still under heavy development, and i'm sure Docker will be entering Telephony soon.</p>

    <link href="http://beingasysadmin.com/blog/2014/02/23/integrating-kamailio-with-freeswitch/"/>
    <updated>2014-02-23T11:05:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://beingasysadmin.com/blog/2014/02/23/integrating-kamailio-with-freeswitch</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><code>Kamailio</code> aka <code>OpenSER</code> is one of the most powerfull and popular Open Source SIP server. It can be used as <strong>SIP Proxy/Registrar/LB/Router</strong> etc. It also provides a lot of features <em>like WebSocket support for WebRTC, ; SIMPLE instant messaging and presence with embedded XCAP server and MSRP relay,IMS extensions,ENUM and offcourse AAA (accounting, authentication and authorization)</em> also. Kamailio is a modular system, ie, it has lot of modules which corresponds to particular functions. These modules can be easily installed and can be used easily in Kamailio. In this blog i'm going to use Kamailio as a proxy server. All the user's are created in the Kamailio and FreeSwitch will be acting as a relay server for outbound calls. So Kamailio performs authentication and all the outbound calls wil be relayed to FreeSwitch.</p>

<h3>Installing Kamailio</h3>

<p>Lets download the latest version of Kamailio, now it's 4.1</p>

<pre><code>$ wget http://www.Kamailio.org/pub/Kamailio/latest/src/Kamailio-4.1.1_src.tar.gz

$ tar xvzf Kamailio-4.1.1_src.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd Kamailio-4.1.1
</code></pre>

<p>Before we start the build we need to install the basic dependencies.</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install gcc flex bison libmysqlclient-dev make libxml2-dev libssl-dev
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have the dependencies installed, we can go ahead with the build.</p>

<pre><code>$ make cfg      # generates config files for build system
</code></pre>

<p>Now open <code>modules.lst</code> and add the modules to be installed in "<strong>include_modules</strong>" section. In my case i'm going to use MySQL backend so it will be "<strong>include_modules= db_mysql</strong>" and then we can run the "<em>make all</em>". The other way is we can mention the modules directly while running the "make" rather editing the modules.lst file.</p>

<pre><code>$ make include_modules="db_mysql" cfg
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can install,</p>

<pre><code>$ make install
</code></pre>

<p>The above command will install Kamailio to our system. There are four main binaries for Kamailio,</p>

<pre><code>Kamailio - Kamailio SIP server
kamdbctl - script to create and manage the Databases
kamctl - script to manage and control Kamailio SIP server
kamcmd - CLI - command line tool to interface with Kamailio SIP server
</code></pre>

<p>There is also one configuration file called "Kamailio.cfg" which is available by default at <code>/usr/local/etc/Kamailio/Kamailio.cfg</code></p>

<p>Let's go ahead with setting up MySQL server for Kamailio.</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-get install mysql-server
</code></pre>

<p>Now edit the <code>/usr/local/etc/Kamailio/kamctlrc</code> Locate DBENGINE variable and set it to MYSQL by making "<strong>DBENGINE=MYSQL</strong>". Now we can use the "kamdbctl" binary to craete the default tables and users.</p>

<pre><code>$ /usr/local/sbin/kamdbctl create
</code></pre>

<p>The script will add two users in MySQL:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Kamailio - (with default password 'Kamailiorw') - user which has full access rights to 'Kamailio' database</p></li>
<li><p>Kamailioro - (with default password 'Kamailioro') - user which has read-only access rights to 'Kamailio' database</p></li>
</ul>


<p>There is a sample init.d script available along with Kamailio, which we can use it. We need to copy the sample init.d file to our system's init.d folder. And the same for the system default file.</p>

<pre><code>$ cp /usr/local/src/Kamailio-4.1.1/pkg/Kamailio/deb/precise/Kamailio.init /etc/init.d/Kamailio

$ cp /usr/local/src/Kamailio-4.1.1/pkg/Kamailio/deb/precise/Kamailio.default /etc/default/Kamailio

$ chmod 755 /etc/init.d/Kamailio 
</code></pre>

<p>Edit the new init file and modify the $DAEMON and $CFGFILE values.</p>

<pre><code>DAEMON=/usr/local/sbin/Kamailio
CFGFILE=/usr/local/etc/Kamailio/Kamailio.cfg

$ mkdir -p /var/run/Kamailio    # Directory for the pid file
</code></pre>

<p>Default setting is to run Kamailio as user "<em>Kamailio</em>" and group "<em>Kamailio</em>". For that we need to create the user:</p>

<pre><code>$ adduser --quiet --system --group --disabled-password \
      --shell /bin/false --gecos "Kamailio" \
      --home /var/run/Kamailio Kamailio

$ chown Kamailio:Kamailio /var/run/Kamailio
</code></pre>

<h3>Setting up Kamailio</h3>

<p>All the Kamailio configurations are mentioned in only one single file <code>/usr/local/etc/Kamailio/Kamailio.cfg</code>. All the logics are defined in this file, and Kamailio blindly executes this logics and perform the actions. It's very important that the logics defined in the config should suit to our VOIP platform requirement.</p>

<p>First we need to enable the modules and the necessary features, so add the below lines in the Kamailio.cfg</p>

<pre><code>#!define WITH_MYSQL
#!define WITH_AUTH
#!define WITH_USRLOCDB
#!define WITH_FREESWITCH
</code></pre>

<p>We need to define the FreeSwitch server IP and port, for that we can add the below parameters in the "Custom Parameters" section.</p>

<pre><code>#!ifdef WITH_FREESWITCH
freeswitch.bindip = "192.168.56.100" desc "FreeSWITCH IP Address"
freeswitch.bindport = "5090" desc "FreeSWITCH Port"
#!endif
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can go ahead to the "<strong>request_route</strong>" section which performs the routing logic. Here i'm going to add two more routing logic for the FreeSwitch relay. After the "<strong>request_route</strong>" section, we can see the definition for each routing options. Below that we need to add our new route definitions.</p>

<pre><code>route[FSDISPATCH] {
        # dial number selection
        route(FSRELAY);
        exit;
}

route[FSRELAY] {
        $du = "sip:" + $sel(cfg_get.freeswitch.bindip) + ":" + $sel(cfg_get.freeswitch.bindport);
        if($var(newbranch)==1)
        {
                append_branch();
                $var(newbranch) = 0;
        }
        route(RELAY);
        exit;
}
</code></pre>

<p>By default, all the routes mentioned in the "request_route" will be executed line by line. There is a default route called "<strong>Location</strong>", which splits the user part from the request URI and verifies if the user exists in the location table. But when we dial an outside number/user, this location check will fail, so i'm going to add a condition which checks if the user in the request URI contains a number with a length 9-15 will be relayed to the FreeSwitch. Again this is just a simple condition, we can create a more complex condition, like check the domain part, if the domain part contains a domain which doesnot belong to our Domain list, we can either decline the request, or we can relay to FreeSwitch or we can make DNS query and we can make Kamailio to process the request to that domain's Proxy server. Like this we can define our own conditions in the config file, and Kamailio will execute it line by line.</p>

<p>I'm going to add my check condition on the "<strong>LOCATION</strong>" route definition.</p>

<pre><code>route[LOCATION] {

    #!ifdef WITH_SPEEDDIAL
        # search for short dialing - 2-digit extension
        if($rU=~"^[0-9][0-9]$")
                if(sd_lookup("speed_dial"))
                        route(SIPOUT);
    #!endif
        if($rU=~"^[0-9]{9,15}$")        # checking for numbers in the Request URI
                route(FSDISPATCH);
    #!ifdef WITH_ALIASDB
        # search in DB-based aliases
        if(alias_db_lookup("dbaliases"))
                route(SIPOUT);
    #!endif
        $avp(oexten) = $rU;
        if (!lookup("location")) {
                xlog("L_INFO", "CALL $rm $ci lookup here\n");
                xlog("L_INFO", "$fU@$fd - Lookup contact location for $rm\n");
                xlog("L_INFO", "rc is $var(rc)");
                switch ($rc) {
                        case -1:
                        case -3:
                                xlog("L_ERR", "$fU@$fd - No contact found\n");
                                send_reply("404", "Not Found here");
                                exit;
                        case -2:
                                send_reply("405", "Method Not Allowed");
                                exit;
                }
        }

        # when routing via usrloc, log the missed calls also
        if (is_method("INVITE"))
        {
                setflag(FLT_ACCMISSED);
        }
        xlog("L_INFO", "CALL $rm $ci relay\n");
        xlog("L_INFO", "$fU@$fd - Relaying $rm\n");
            route(RELAY);
        exit;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So now all the calls coming with numbers of length 9-15 in the Request URI will be relayed to the FreeSwitch, and FreeSwitch will process the call based on the DialPlan configured in the FreeSwitch. Since i'm going to use IP authentication, i need to whitelist the Kamailio ip in "acl_conf.xml" file in the FreeSwitch autload conf directory, so that FreeSwitch will accept the invites from Kamailio. Again i'm not defining any Voicemail options here. If we have a Voice mail server, then we can create another route option and when the caller doesn't pick the call we can route the call to the Voice Mail server.
For example the below condition will route the failures to FreeSwitch Voice Mailbox.</p>

<pre><code>if(is_method("INVITE"))
        {
            # in case of failure - re-route to FreeSWITCH VoiceMail
            t_on_failure("FAIL_FSVBOX");        # where FSVBOX is a route definition
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Kamailio has a lot of modules which really comes in handy. For example we can use LDAP module to use LDAP as a backend. There is a PRESENCE module which helps us to setup an Instant Messaging server using Kamailio. I'll be writing a blog on how to use Kamailio as an IM server soon. One of the main advantage of Kamailio over OpenSIP is the WebSocket support. This just a basic configuration, but we can design much complex system using Kamailio. We can even remove the default route logics, and we can use our own routing logics. Kamailio doesnot depend on default routing logics, it blindly reads the route and executes it for each incoming connections.</p>
